This file lists the various things we wish to be able to do with a tournament archive, with a view to understanding the scope of what information it needs to allow for. Not everything will be doable with every file, because most fields in the specification will be optional, but the idea is that the standard should provide space for it.

These are things that someone should be able to do with a tournament archive, not necessarily things that the archive itself should do. At this stage it's more of a brainstormâ€”things in this file may yet be ruled out of scope.
